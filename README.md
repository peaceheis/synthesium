Synthesium is an animation library inspired by the effort to <em>programmatically</em> generate animations based on synesthesia.

The first <a href= "https://github.com/peaceheis/synthesium/releases/tag/v0.1">working version</a> is available, but I'd like to actually rewrite everyting in Rust now that I've designed what I believe to be a quality API surface.
