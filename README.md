# Synthesium - combining coding and creativity.
Synthesium is an animation engine inspired by the effort to <em>programmatically</em> generate animations based on synesthesia.
There's still quite a long way to go until it's ready, but when it becomes workable, it will be a tool to use code to animate, 
without sacrificing expressiveness.
