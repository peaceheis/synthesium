# Synthesium 
Synthesium is an animation library inspired by the effort to <em>programmatically</em> generate animations based on synesthesia.

The first <a href= "https://github.com/peaceheis/synthesium/releases/tag/v0.1">working version</a> is available, but I've shifted my focus onto a better version of Synthesium - <a href = "https://github.com/peaceheis/cynthesium">Cynthesium</a>, a rewrite of Synthesium from the ground up in C++. Stay tuned! After rewrites, I plan on creating Python bindings for Cynthesium, so you can have blazing-fast rendering from the comfort of your favorite dynamically-typed language.
